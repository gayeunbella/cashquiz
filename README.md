##Inspiration
We realized that people often stop studying when there is no motivation to study and that almost everyone loves money. We then came up with this idea where we could use money(gift cards) to motivate students.

##What it does
It quizzes users and when they get something right, they get points, which they can use to buy giftcards of their choice.

##How we built it
We built it through Replit using React.js

##Challenges we ran into
It was our first time coding with React.js, so we had to learn everything while programming. So some of the functions often stopped working midway or was hard to code. We figured it out by asking our peers and Googling.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
Weâ€™re proud of the fact that we were able to complete a project and submit it within 10 hours.

##What we learned
We learned how to use React.js

##What's next for Cash Quiz
Adding additional features such as choosing subjects to be quizzed on and multi-player games
